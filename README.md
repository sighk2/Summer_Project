Interactive Video based project using P5.js, HTML, CSS

In this project, I am trying to slice up a video into a grid to create an interactive jugsaw puzzle eventually. 
In much the same way as we slice up static images in Processing or Javascript, I am trying to chunk the video into a 4*4 grid 
and display the blocks in the browser. 

I managed to chunk the video into the rectangular pieces but it seems like there is no way to display the chunks unless the whole video itself is also displayed in the window. I am trying to display just the chunks and not the whole video. Any suggested workaround for this ?
